# WikiLearn
## A tool that streamlines and encourages learning in your web-browsing experience.

How often are you reading an interesting article, when all of sudden you see a phrase or word that confuses you? How annoying is it to then have to open up a new tab and look this word/phrase? Well with WikiLearn this process becomes streamlined and simple!
Come across something you don't know? Simply highlight the word/phrase, and our new WikiLearn extension will pop-up a mini WikiPeda Page for the given word/phrase. In this pop-up users can scroll through the page as well as click the built-in WikiPedia links to traverse even more pages.
But most importantly, WikiLearn will contribute to fact checking articles in an age of fake news. This is because it is a versatile tool that can easily give you reference sources for material you might be skeptical about. If you ever come across something you don't believe is true, all you have to do is highlight the key words of the article to get a better understanding of what is being said and truly see if you have found fake news!

## Installation
Simple download or clone this repository to you computer and open up chrome://extensions. Turn on Dev move and press load unpacked, then point Chrome to the folder you downloaded. Then WikiLearn will run on all new pages you open up. Simple!

## Usage
Simply highlight a word or phrase on a webpage. If there's a Wikipedia entry for what you highlighted, WikiLearn will show it to you in a popup window. From there, you may click on other Wikipedia links within the mini-browser and continue learning, all while remaining on the tab of your original article! To close the popup, simply click away from it. Furthermore, whenever you have a wikipedia page open in the popup window, simple press W to smoothly and simply open the Wikipedia page in a new window.
