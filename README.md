# WikiLearn
## A tool that streamlines and encourages learning in your web-browsing experience.

How frequently do you open new tabs to search for something on Wikipedia? With WikiLearn, you can view the Wikipedia entry for anything without leaving the page you're on.

## Usage
Simply highlight a word or phrase on a webpage. If there's a Wikipedia entry for what you highlighted, WikiLearn will show it to you in a popup window. From there, you may click on other Wikipedia links within the mini-browser and continue learning, all while remaining on the tab of your original article! To close the popup, simply click away from it.
