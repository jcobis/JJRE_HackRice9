# WikiLearn
## A tool that streamlines and encourages learning in your web-browsing experience.

How often are you reading an interesting article, when all of sudden you see a phrase or word that confuses you? How cubermose and obtrusive is it to then have to open up a new tab and look up this word/phrase? With WikiLearn, this process becomes streamlined and simple!
Come across something you don't know? Simply highlight the word/phrase, and our new WikiLearn extension will pop-up a mini Wikipedia page for the given word/phrase. In this pop-up, users can scroll through the page, as well as click the built-in Wikipedia links to traverse even more pages.

## WikiLearn: an educational and fact-checking tool
WikiLearn encourages learning for young children and people of all ages by enabling unobtrusive, intuitive Wikipedia searches. A score is kept of how many terms you read about to encourage continual learning. Additionally, in an age of fake news, WikiLearn enables quick fact-checking for articles. With this versatile tool, you can easily reference sources for material you might be skeptical about. If you ever come across something you are unsure is true, highlight the key-words of the article to get a better understanding of topic and the article's validity!

## Usage
Simply highlight a word or phrase on a webpage. If there's a Wikipedia entry for what you highlighted, WikiLearn will show it to you in a popup window. From there, you may click on other Wikipedia links within the mini-browser and continue learning, all while remaining on the tab of your original article! To close the popup, simply click away from it. Furthermore, whenever you have a wikipedia page open in the popup window, simple press W to smoothly and simply open the Wikipedia page in a new window. Also note the learning features in the extension menu!
